# Onboarding Types used by Translators
Onboarding is a generic term for any setup, pairing, auth, etc. that one typically needs to do before communicating with a device.

The alpha version defines a few onboarding types that are used by Open Translators to Things. We would love to see the community add more onboarding types for different categories of things.
